## Purpose:

The Customer Segmentation Model aims to classify customers into different segments based on their annual income and spending score. By segmenting customers, businesses can gain insights into their behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns, enabling targeted marketing strategies, personalized product recommendations, and improved customer engagement.

## Model Description:

The Customer Segmentation Model is a machine learning model trained on historical customer data. It utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to partition customers into distinct clusters based on their similarity in annual income and spending score. The model assigns each customer to the cluster that minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares, effectively grouping customers with similar characteristics together.

## Usage:

1. Input Data:

The model requires input data consisting of customers' annual income and spending score.
Ensure that the input data is preprocessed and formatted appropriately before feeding it into the model.
Prediction:

To predict the segment of a new customer, provide their annual income and spending score as input to the trained model.
The model will return the predicted cluster label for the customer, indicating which segment they belong to.
Interpretation:

Once the model predicts the cluster label for a customer, refer to the cluster descriptions to understand the characteristics and behavior of customers in that segment.
Use these insights to tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to better serve the needs of each customer segment.
Implementation:

2. Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the input data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Scale or normalize the features as necessary to ensure that all variables contribute equally to the clustering process.

3. Model Training:

Train the Customer Segmentation Model using the preprocessed data and the K-means clustering algorithm.
Determine the optimal number of clusters (K) using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette score.

4. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using relevant metrics such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or visual inspection of cluster separation.
Iterate on the model and parameter tuning as needed to improve performance.
